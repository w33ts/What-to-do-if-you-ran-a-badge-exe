# If you ran a .exe program to get the Active Developer badge, read below.
Alright, so that wasn't the smartest move but we all make mistakes and I know I've done worse. However, this doesn't negate the fact that you might have compromised your system or may lose access to your Discord account

## Why?
You don't know what that .exe ultimately contains. The fact that you ran a .exe to get a Discord badge instead of making a bot indicates to me that you may not know how to do a static analysis of source code. Unless you **READ AND UNDERSTAND** the source code and **COMPILED IT YOURSELF**, you don't know what it's doing. It only takes one request to an external web server to bring down a malicious payload into an otherwise non-malicious program. Don't trust people on the internet.

## Okay, what now?
First and foremost, go reset your Discord password **ASAP** and then don't log back into Discord until you complete the following steps.

After that, delete whatever you downloaded and then restart your computer. If whatever you downloaded didn't establish any sort of persistence, this *should* kill it in theory for sure.

Once completed, get Sophos Hitman Pro https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/hitmanpro and run it.

Afterwards, a good AV to ensure everything is kosher is Kaspersky. Before you moan about it, no it's not Russian and their HQ is based in Europe. It's very good at what it does. https://usa.kaspersky.com/free-antivirus

Note: As your first lesson, don't trust those links and search it up yourself.

After you complete the steps above, you *should* be able to have reasonable confidence that your system is no longer compromised. The threat level of those outputting these malicious .exe programs is low, around the "script kiddie" level, so you're having to worry about North Korean APTs dropping stuff on your system. They're not concerned with small fries.

## Who the hell are you and why should I trust you?
You shouldn't, ultimately. I'm just a dude on the internet, so do your own research. *However*, I *am* a certified industry expert, so at least give some thought to the above.

If you have any questions, DM me @ w33t.io on Discord or join https://discord.gg/cyberinfo.

Good luck and be careful out there.
